# Multi-user Blog for Intro to Backend Udacity Course

Final project for the Udacity course “Intro to Backend” in support of the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree].(https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) Application written using Bootstrap, Google App Engine, Google Datastore. Written in Python, HTML, and CSS using fully responsive web design. Uses App Engine's included Jinja2 templates. Code editor: Sublime Text with Flask8 Linter. Cookies and passwords salted and hashed using SHA256.

## Quickstart:

Please note: this readme is written for extracting the project from the blog_phelps.zip file, not directly from Github. That will come later.

The project requires Python 2.7 or higher, the files in the structure listed below in “What’s Included”, and Google App Engine.

To set up the project, unzip files to a system folder, maintaining the directory structure. To initiate the project locally, run the dev_appserver.py app.yaml command from within the "blog_phelps" directory (or whatever name was chosen). Once initiated, the user will need to create a username and password (or login, if a username and password has been previously created), and begin to populate the blog from the home page.
